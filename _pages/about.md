<!-- I study large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents. -->

I am currently a final-year Master's student in Computer Science at Shandong University, advised by Prof. <a href="https://renzhaochun.github.io/">Zhaochun Ren</a> (now in Leiden University, Netherlands).
I have also been fortunate to  work closely with <a href="https://imsure318.github.io/">Shuo Zhang</a> at Bloomberg and <a href="https://sunnweiwei.github.io/">Weiwei Sun</a> at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

I receive my B.E. degree from Shandong University.
During my undergraduate studies, I was selected for the **Elite Class program**, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://renzhaochun.github.io/">Zhaochun Ren</a>, where I developed a strong interest in areas such as NLP.
Feel free to view my <a href="./assets/pdf/CV-Zhengliang-Shi.pdf">CV</a> and <a href="./assets/pdf/transcript-Zhengliang-Shi.pdf">transcript</a>.

🤔 I am always excited about exploring practical, interesting problems, and have spent a wonderful time in core industry teams.
I previously interned at Baidu's Search Science Team, supervised by <a href="https://yindawei.com">Dr. Dawei Yin</a>.
I also interned at the HunYuan team at Tencent, supervised by <a href="https://tuzhaopeng.github.io/">Dr. Zhaopeng Tu</a>.

🧐 I work broadly on natural language processing and information retrieval, with a particular emphasis on LLMs.
I investigate the core limitations of LLMs, such as hallucinations and the inability to interact with the digital world, that cannot be overcome by scaling alone.
To address these challenges, my previous studies pioneered **Tool-use LLMs**, a novel class of LLMs that can automatically use various, external tools (e.g., code libraries, function-callings, or Web APIs) for complex task solving.
This is also well-known as the **LLM-based Agents**.
 

##### Research interests

- 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- 🔧 Tool-using LLMs and LLM-based Agents
- 🤖 Agentic Reasoning
- 😄 *As the field goes rapidly, I actively explore new ideas and embrace new directions.* 

<!-- - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): identifying and retrieving the most useful information from large external corpora to enhance the factuality of LLMs

- Tool-using LLMs and LLM-based Agents: enabling language-model-based agents to interact with external environments through tool use, allowing them to solve complex, real-world tasks on behalf of humans.

- Agentic Reasoning: developing LLM-based agents that can plan over long horizons and solve problems through structured, step-by-step reasoning.

I am broadly interested in emerging directions in LLMs and agent systems, and I actively explore new ideas as the field evolves rapidly. -->
