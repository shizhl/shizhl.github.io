(as of December 20, 2025)

I am Zhengliang Shi, a computer science researcher. I received my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Shandong University in 2023 and am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Computer Science at Shandong University, with an expected graduation in 2026.

I am deeply interested in building open-ended agents that can provide unbiased and helpful assistance to humans. 
To achieve this, my research focuses on natural language processing and large language models, spanning both practical applications and theoretical foundations.
I am particularly motivated by fundamental research questions and strive to develop simple, elegant solutions that deepen our understanding of intelligent systems. (Elegance typically means autonomous and scalable!)

Beyond research, I enjoy communicating with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures. I also enjoy traveling and have visited several countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Canada, the United States, and the Netherlands. 
My favorite cities are Beijing, China, and San Diego, United States.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to connect!
